A POSIXLY-compliant mv command.

This code will compile on any C89 system.
On such systems, it requires an exact path to the destination, and not just 
a destination directory.  Also, it will not be able to tell if a destination 
exists.

On a POSIX system (with the __unix__ macro defined) the above limitations 
go away.

On a Windows system (WinNT only, Win2K+, tested on WinXP) 
(with the _WIN32 macro defined) the above limitations go away. 
Also, if a file is currently open when the rename is attempted, it will be 
set to complete the move after reboot, a message to this effect will be 
printed, and the exit code will be 110.
